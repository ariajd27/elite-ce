### Controls

## Menu navigation

Left (out): y=
Right (in): graph
Cursor navigation: arrow keys
Select: enter

The exact behavior of these buttons depends on the state of the ship. There is a virtual set of adjacent panels that are navigated between. While docked at a station, they are laid out like this:

``|================|================|===============|================|``
``|                |                |               |                |``
``|   outfitting   |  market link   | ship computer | selected panel |``
``|                |                |               |                |``
``|================|================|===============|================|``

While in flight, the flight view is left of the ship computer, so pressing GRAPH in flight will bring up the ship computer, and pressing y= in the ship computer while not docked at a station will return to the flight view. Also, for more universally intuitive UX, the panel currently selected in the ship computer menu can be accessed by pressing GRAPH or ENTER, with no functional difference between the two.

The flight simulation is paused while in a menu.
